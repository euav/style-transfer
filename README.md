# Style transfer with deep convolution neural network
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook file `style-transfer.ipynb` on neural style transfer. Algorithm uses VGG-16 as features extractor and optimizes output image with gradient descent \[1\]. For demonstrational purposes several images were put in the folder `images` and will be used in the notebook.
